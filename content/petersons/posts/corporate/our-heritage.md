Peterson's Market was started in 1938 by Louis William Peterson, affectionately called "Lute". His youngest son Bruce Peterson along with his wife Dona took over the business in 1951 and have grown the company from its humble beginnings to what you see now, a full-service grocery store.

Our store is still family-owned and is currently operated by Monte and Jan. We are a full-service, family-oriented store. We offer the finest fresh foods including, USDA choice beef, top quality produce, a scratch bakery and a unique deli with delicious ready to eat entrees. Our Pharmacy also makes custom compounded prescriptions.

We work hard to fulfill any special requests or orders quickly and efficiently. The customer is always first in our store and we feel that we are exactly what you searching for, that good old hometown grocery store.
