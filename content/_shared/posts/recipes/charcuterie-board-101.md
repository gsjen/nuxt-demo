Your cheese choices are the foundation to the perfect charcuterie board. We recommend challenging yourself with as many cheeses as you desire, but at minimum 3-4 kinds will give you the combination to start things off right. Taking one from each of these categories will hit the cheese palette necessities:

- Firm
  - Your choice of firm cheeses can potentially be the most overwhelming with the variety we offer, but also the most recognizable to most cheese lovers. Providing your guests with something familiar is the base for the cheese portion of your board.
  - A few favorites that will please all cheese lovers are Parmesan, Manchego, Swiss or Gruyere.
- Soft
  - Soft cheeses will be the fresh, creamy and easily spreadable types. Easy to eat on a cracker or bread, these types prevent the prolonged effort of slicing while everyone else waits their turn.
  - Select from crowd favorites like Brie, Fresh Mozzarella or Burrata, or change things up with Goat Cheese or Chevre for a tangy flavor.
- Blue
  - Regardless if you love stinky cheese or not, the blue cheese family is a charcuterie board staple.
  - For the blue cheese lovers, we recommend Gorgonzola, Roquefort or Stilton.
- Aged
  - The final category we recommend are of the aged and matured variety. The ripening of these cheeses in controlled conditions allows for a texture and flavor that stands apart from the others.
  - We recommend the classics like Gouda, Comte, and White Cheddar.

**Next up, meat.**
